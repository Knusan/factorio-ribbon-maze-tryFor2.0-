-- class Cmwc
--
-- A pure lua Complimentary-Multiply-With-Carry random number generator
-- This is used in place of Lua's builtin math.random, which is platform-specific
--
-- A lag of 4 is used. While minimal by CMWC standards, the amount of random numbers
-- required is relatively small, so the periodicity is still excellent for our purposes.

-- Based on "Random Number Generators", by George Marsaglia
